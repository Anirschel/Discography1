<h2><font face="candara" color="Grey"><font size="4" color="grey" HEIGHT="300" WIDTH="300" BORDER=10">American rock band formed in Las Vegas, Nevada in 2001, by Brandon Flowers (lead vocals, keyboards) and Dave Keuning (guitar, backing vocals). Mark Stoermer (bass guitar, backing vocals) and Ronnie Vannucci Jr. (drums, percussion) would complete the current line-up of the band in 2002. The name The Killers is derived from a logo on the bass drum of a fictitious band, portrayed in the music video for the New Order song "Crystal".[1]
The group has released four chart topping studio albums: Hot Fuss (2004), Sam's Town (2006), Day & Age (2008) and Battle Born (2012). They have also released a B-sides and rarities compilation, Sawdust (2007); a live album, Live from the Royal Albert Hall (2009); and a greatest hits album Direct Hits (2013).
The Killers are seen as one of the biggest rock bands of the 21st century,[2] and the most successful rock act to ever emerge from the state of Nevada, having sold an estimated 22 million albums worldwide.[3] They have achieved worldwide success as a live band, performing in over fifty countries and on six continents, headlining venues such as Madison Square Garden and Wembley Stadium.
